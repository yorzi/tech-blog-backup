    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After quit from Idapted/Eleutian, I'd like to have a long term plan for writing blogs. However, as everything starts, it's always hard. I thought it around, and finally decided to open my mind, and just try to start with a strong belief : Sharing! Then an idea comes out.</p>

<p>First of all, I think my weekly updates will help to share great things I came across or even I started to use, it has much fun to replay all these stuff, so I will do that in the weekend, that's also part of my study review.</p>

<p>Ok, turn to the points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Now you must know <a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/index.htm">JSLint</a>. JSlint is a Javascript checker, which can help you ensure your JS' quality. There are many great open source projects helping you to program in Javascript.</li>
</ol>

Github Proj: <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint">https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint</a>
Add JSLint to you TextMate: <a href="https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle">https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are you familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a>? You should start to learn it now if you did not have a change to give it a try. Specially, if you are using Ruby/Ruby on Rails, I strongly recommend you try <a href="http://rspec.info/">rSpec</a> for the BDD. Back to the topic, I wanna share with you some similar BDD way in programming Javascript, <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jspec">jspec</a> and <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>, obviously, they are cool. I just mention this as a reminder people who want to try interesting programming. I didn't try them yet, but I guess I will do that in soon.</p></li>

<p>Javascript is a long journey, I am just on the start point. Anyway, exciting!</p>

    <link href="http://yorzi.github.com/2011/02/18/real-time-application-with-rails3/"/>

    <id>http://yorzi.github.com/2011/02/18/real-time-application-with-rails3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I researched a little bit these two days about Real-Time Application(RTA), I found many useful solution to build real-time application.</p>

<p>First, a RTA is an application program that functions within a time frame that the user senses as immediate or current. The latency must be less than a defined value, usually measured in seconds. The use of RTAs is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real-time computing</a> (RTC).</p>

<p>There are some example use cases of RTAs, including:</p>

<pre>
   * Videoconference applications
   * VoIP (voice over Internet Protocol)
   * Online gaming
   * Community storage solutions
   * Chatting
   * IM (instant messaging)
</pre>


<p>Mainly, I am interested in two solutions, which are <a href="https://github.com/lifo/cramp">Cramp</a> based RTA and a NR2J(<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>+<a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis">Redis</a>+<a href="https://github.com/maccman/juggernaut">Juggernaut</a>+Jquery) solution, both of these two solutions have existing samples, I suggest you should go through all of them to understand RTA well.</p>

<p><strong>Cramp based RTA</strong>
Cramp is a ruby web framework with asynchronous feature, which is always running inside EventMachine reactor loop, there is a <a href="http://m.onkey.org/introducing-cramp">detailed introduction</a> for it. A sample code is <a href="https://github.com/akitaonrails/cramp_chat_demo">available here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NR2J solution</strong>
Introduction is <a href="http://www.golygon.com/2010/12/private-chat-room-in-ruby-on-rails-3-0/">here</a> and sample code is <a href="https://github.com/prabgupt/chatclient">here</a>. I tried Node.js before, it's getting popular recently, but I still don't be used to implementing server side code with JS. I love Ruby and Rails anyway.</p>
