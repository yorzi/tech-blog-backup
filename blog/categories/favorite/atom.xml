    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it's more than two months in which I didn't write up any post here. I know I'd like to, but time was so hard to me, heavy working load and many life issues made me tired, of course I am still happy with all challenges as well. Anyway, I've got many technology things/thoughts and tips that I want to share out.</p>

<p>Today, I will announce a gem named acts_as_favable, the gem helps you adding notable favorites mark to multi-objects. For example, you want to add a favorite mark to a video or a discussion with your notes, now that's very easy to do that with acts_as_favable.</p>

<p>Technically, <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/acts_as_favable">acts_as_favable</a> is very similar with the gem acts_as_commentable or acts_as_votable, they are all about your actions on a specific object, so you can group them easily in user's page. Yeah, this gem is simple, I just use it in one of my application, it's Rails3 compatible.</p>

<p>Why not just try it out if you want your user to add their favorites of some object(books/CDs etc.), more details is on github at:
<a href="https://github.com/yorzi/acts_as_favable">https://github.com/yorzi/acts_as_favable</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you have any question about using this gem/plugin in your project.</p>
